            <p>
                Okey so let's get started with some a11y.
                a11y is a numeronym for accessibility and is massively part of a UX-designers work.
                However a designers great work could be useless if the code doesn't do what it's supposed to.
                The content on this page will have CSS to make pretty - but we'll focus on the HTML basic for you developers.

                <h2>Why accessible?</h2>
                <p>
                    Okey so the boring answer is: <em>because you're not a terrible person</em>.
                    <br>
                    Accessibility is useful for most people, and absolutely neccessary for others.
                    <br>
                    According to that it is bound by discrimation-laws in most countries.

                <b>Accessibility is cash!</b> If you run a business you cannot avoid this.

                A badly coded website could look as pretty as it wants - but if a user cannot get what they came for it's pointless.
                We code with a11y in mind - so users with assistive technologies, or invisible disabilities could use the website with ease.
                <br>
                Oh yeah - also it also flies well with google and other search engines!

                <br>
                Some guidelines to follow are based on mobile-friendly functions, contrasting for screens in sunlight, and not forcing the user to remember or hurry.
                All in all that makes a website more manageable without timepressure and poorly designed content.

                It makes you aware of what you're coding, and it also makes the next person more likely to understand what you are coding!
                <br>
                What you use for accessibility is as a beginning clean code. Limit your divs, and make the code be what it is supposed to be.
                It's easy to use the "wrong element" because it demands less fixing in style - but you create code that is hard tpo understand later on.

                <h3>Header levels</h3>
                <p>So first of all - you should use header elements in a programmatical order. Not based on the size they come out in. You could easily fix that with adding the size-styling on a class.</p>
                <img class="half-width" src="img/code1-bad-example.png" alt="a bad code example where a h4 follows directly after a h1 element" />
                <img class="half-width" src="img/code11-good-example.png" alt="a imrpoved code example where following the h1 is a h2 element with a class to make it smaller" />
                <p>This way you can insert the correct header for it to make sense - and getting the look you want. Bootstrap and other styling libraries made us a bit lazy on this.</p>

                <h4>Why?</h4>
                <p>
                    There are many reasons why you should do this. It validates your code properly - and it indicates which text belongs to which headers.
                    If you have a lot of headers nested and the header-levels doesn't make sense, you cannot programmaticly determine which headers are connected and not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assistive technologies like screen readers often browse by headers on many websites. By coding them in nested levels they know which to easily skip because they belong together and not.

                <br>
                The newest version is 2.1 and you should follow this to a minimum of AA standard.
