# a11y-from-yay-to-nay
Ever wondered how you can improve your html to improve accessibility?

The purpose of this repo is to give examples of bad code and how to imrpove it.
For the startin up purpose this will contain simple html/css/js.
This could, and should however change over time to show pressing issues in a more "realistic" scenario where we use other frameworks.

## Why a11y?
Well - a lot of reasons comes to mind - but in short you might be forced to by laws of discrimation.
Adding to that it makes the website more usable, and creates code that will score better in SEO, 
be faster onload and easier to read for the next developer.

I recommend reading the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 from W3C
